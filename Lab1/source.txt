The w+ mode is designed for scenarios where you want to create a new file or completely replace 
the contents of an existing one. 
    If the file exists: Its entire content is immediately truncated (deleted), and the file pointer is 
positioned at the beginning.
    If the file does not exist: A new, empty file is created.
    Pointer Position: The file pointer starts at the beginning of the file.
    Use Case: Ideal for writing new data from scratch and then potentially reading that data back 
within the same session.
